        For starters, you can remove the extra elements (0) and leave only the building elements, dividing them string by string. Such methods for working with strings, like
<a href='https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace'>replace()</a> and <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str.split'>split()</a> will help you with that.

        How can I write this in Python?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Code will look like this:
        <pre class="brush: python">
plan = plan.replace('0', '')
plan = plan.split('\n')
        </pre>
The first string replaces all '0' with an empty string (''), the second - separates the multiline string into separate strings, using the linefeed character '\n' as the separating element.

        How can I calculate the area needed to build a house?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        To determine the area of the required rectangular land plot you need to multiply the longest element of the plan list (the length of the house) by the number of such elements in the list (the width of the house).  To determine the longest element use the <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max'>max() function</a>, and to determine the length of the list use the <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len'>len() function</a>.

        I would like to see how this will be written in Python.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Given the previous part of the solution, it will look like this:
        <pre class="brush: python">
plan = plan.replace('0','')
plan = plan.split('\n')
answer = len(max(plan)) * len(plan)        
</pre>

    <div class="question">
        Some plans have strings where nothing is built at all (''). How can I get rid of them so that len(plan) returns the correct value?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        In this case you can use the <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace'>replace() method</a>, which removes the selected element from the list.

        I donâ€™t quite understand how to use this in our case.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can use the while loop to remove empty elements until they are completely gone. For example:
        <pre class="brush: python">
while '' in plan:
    plan.remove('')        
</pre>
    </div>
</div>
