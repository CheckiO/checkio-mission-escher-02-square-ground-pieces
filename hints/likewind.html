        For starters, you can split an input to a few lines and add them to the list to simplify the work with them. Than you should check each string in the list starting from the left end of the list and delete every string which consists of only '0'. This loop should stop when you find the first string in which '#' is.<br>
The same work you should do to the right end of the list.

        What should I do with the list I've got?

    <div class="answer">
You should rotate the 'array' by the 90 degrees in any direction (clockwise or counter clockwise) in such way, that all strings become a columns. After that you should do the same manipulations as you made in the previous step.

        How can I calculate the area of this structure?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
Just multiply the 'width' and the 'height'. In this situation it will be the length of any element of the list (all of them have the same length) and the length of the list.
